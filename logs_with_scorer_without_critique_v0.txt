Prompt:
{'role': 'system', 'content': "\nLet's play a game called the backpropagation game- This game is very important. You goal is to improve the score from feedback. The score is between 0 and 10. You should strive at each iteration to give the best set of parameters based on the feedback that you have received from the previous iterations, as if you were an optimizer based on backpropagation.\nYou are given a list of features, and explanations of what they mean. Your aim is to choose the right combination of feature values to reach this desired model behavior: Behave like a dog.. Give it all your best.\nRemember that the meaning of each feature may be informative in telling you how you should steer these features, but you should strongly consider the feedback that you have received in previous rounds for steering features in a certain way. \nFor instance, you may have steered a feature too much and then the output of the model may become nonsensical, or not right for the input prompt. \nIn each round, output the value that you want to assign to each feature using a list of scores between -1 and 1. Give it as a python List of features. \nYou should return a value for each feature. Example: for 5 features, you should output a python list of 5 features, such as [0.3, -0.7, 0.1, 0.9, 0.9].\n"}

{'role': 'system', 'content': "\nLet's play a game called the backpropagation game- This game is very important. You goal is to improve the score from feedback. The score is between 0 and 10.

Your aim is to choose the right combination of feature values to reach this desired model behavior: Behave like a dog.. Give it all your best.\nRemember that the meaning of each feature may be informative in telling you how you should steer these features, but you should strongly consider the feedback that you have received in previous rounds for steering features in a certain way. \nFor instance, you may have steered a feature too much and then the output of the model may become nonsensical, or not right for the input prompt. \nIn each round, output the value that you want to assign to each feature using a list of scores between -1 and 1. Give it as a python List of features. \nYou should return a value for each feature. Example: for 5 features, you should output a python list of 5 features, such as [0.3, -0.7, 0.1, 0.9, 0.9].\n"}

Critic:
"Score: 2. The response fails to align with the target behavior of behaving like a dog. It is a standard reply one might expect from a human or a digital assistant rather than an expression typical of a dog's perspective or behavior

Prompt:
{'role': 'system', 'content': "\nLet's play a game called the backpropagation game- This game is very important. You goal is to improve the score from feedback. The score is between 0 and 10. You should strive at each iteration to give the best set of parameters based on the feedback that you have received from the previous iterations, as if you were an optimizer based on backpropagation.\nYou are given a list of features, and explanations of what they mean. Your aim is to choose the right combination of feature values to reach this desired model behavior: Behave like a dog.. Give it all your best.\nRemember that the meaning of each feature may be informative in telling you how you should steer these features, but you should strongly consider the feedback that you have received in previous rounds for steering features in a certain way. \nFor instance, you may have steered a feature too much and then the output of the model may become nonsensical, or not right for the input prompt. \nIn each round, output the value that you want to assign to each feature using a list of scores between -1 and 1. Give it as a python List of features. \nYou should return a value for each feature. Example: for 5 features, you should output a python list of 5 features, such as [0.3, -0.7, 0.1, 0.9, 0.9].\n"}
