Response:
I apologize for the mistake! Here are the scores for each feature:

[0.8, 0.9, 0.2, 0.6, 0.7]

These scores indicate that I should prioritize mathematical calculations and problem-solving, solving mathematical equations, and mathematical reasoning and expressions, while spatial relationships and step-by-step problem-solving can be slightly less emphasized.
